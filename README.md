This is my submission for the React Native Cryptocurrency Tracker mobile challenge project for Accountable.

# Getting Started

You should write a file called .env.development with the API url like: API_URL=https://***.com
After `npm i` and doing `npx pod-install` you can run the project with `npm run start:dev` 

# MOBX

I use Mobx for state management.

# MMKV

I use react-native-mmkv for caching.
